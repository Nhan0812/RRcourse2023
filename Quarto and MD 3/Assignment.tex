(From the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones\#Premise}{Wikipedia})
Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created
by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song
of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the
first of which is A Game of Thrones.

Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones
has a large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs throughout the
course of the show. A major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven
Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the
noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for
independence from it. Another focuses on the last descendant of the
realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is
plotting a return to the throne. A third story arc follows the Night's
Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from the
North.

Joffrey sets Sansa aside to marry Margaery Tyrell and ally with the
Tyrell family. Tyrion fears for his and Shae's safety after Tywin is
named Hand of the King. Melisandre gives Stannis a new hope. Brienne
kills Stark soldiers after they recognize Jaime. Catelyn fails to
dissuade Robb from marrying Talisa, breaking his promise to wed Walder
Frey's daughter. In Qarth, inside the House of the Undying, Daenerys
enters a simulacrum of a destroyed Iron Throne room, then is reunited
with what appears to be Khal Drogo and their infant son. Knowing it is
unreal, she leaves and successfully retrieves her dragons, who fatally
burn Pree, who tries to imprison her. She seals Daxos and her traitorous
servant inside his empty vault and claims his other possessions, with
which Jorah will pay for a small ship. In Winterfell, Theon wants his
men to fight Robb's army, but they knock him unconscious and leave;
Winterfell is torched. Fatally wounded Maester Luwin convinces Osha to
escape with Brandon and Rickon to the Wall for Jon's protection. After
Arya, Hot Pie, and Gendry escape Harrenhal, H'ghar gives Arya a
non-monetary coin he says can be used to find him in Braavos. Before
her, he magically changes his face. North of the Wall, Halfhand forces
Jon to kill him to prove his loyalty to the Wildlings. An army of White
Walkers and dead men surrounds the Fist of the First Men; Sam hides,
watching in horror as they pass.
